## 🔧 Database Migration Required

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for testing)

If you're okay with clearing existing reactions:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reactions CASCADE;

-- Then run the entire setup.sql file again
```

### Option 2: Migrate Existing Data

Run `database-migration-emoji-reactions.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This will:
-- 1. Add user_hash column
-- 2. Populate existing reactions with 'legacy_user'
-- 3. Add indexes for performance
-- 4. Prevent duplicate reactions per user
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Run the migration SQL** in Supabase
2. **Refresh your app** at `http://localhost:3000/pulse/dashboard`
3. **View a message** - you should see 4 emoji buttons
4. **Click an emoji** - it should highlight (active state)
5. **Click again** - it should remove your reaction
6. **Check the public feed** at `/pulse/feed` - emojis should work there too!
