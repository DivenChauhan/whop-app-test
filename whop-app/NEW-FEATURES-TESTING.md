- [ ] Button changes to active state (colored background)
- [ ] Click again → count decrements
- [ ] Button returns to inactive state
- [ ] Reaction persists after page refresh

**Test user isolation:**
- [ ] Open feed in incognito/private window
- [ ] Same user shouldn't be able to add same reaction twice
- [ ] Different users can add the same reaction

---

### ✅ 6. Analytics - Old Unanswered Messages

**Create test scenario:**
1. You need a message that's > 3 days old
2. Option A: Manually modify database `created_at` field:
   ```sql
   UPDATE messages 
   SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '4 days' 
   WHERE id = 'YOUR_MESSAGE_ID';
   ```
3. Option B: Wait 3 days (not practical for testing)

**Verify:**
- [ ] Message appears in analytics alert section
- [ ] Shows message preview
- [ ] Shows creation date
- [ ] Count is accurate
- [ ] Same message is highlighted in dashboard

---

### ✅ 7. Navbar Update

**Check navigation:**
- [ ] Navbar has "Analytics" link
- [ ] Click navigates to `/pulse/analytics`
- [ ] Active state highlights correct page
- [ ] All other links still work

---

## 🎨 Visual Checks

### Badge Hierarchy
When a message has multiple states, verify correct priority:

1. **Old Unanswered** (highest priority)
   - Gets "⚠️ NEEDS REPLY" badge
   - Yellow/orange border
   - Hot badge is hidden if also hot

2. **Hot Message** (second priority)
   - Gets "🔥 HOT" badge
   - Orange border
   - Only shows if not old unanswered

3. **New Message** (shown alongside others)
   - Gets "NEW" badge in header
   - Can coexist with hot/old unanswered

### Color Scheme Consistency
- [ ] Blue = New messages, Questions
- [ ] Green = Feedback, Positive states
- [ ] Purple = Confessions, Product categories
- [ ] Orange/Red = Hot messages, Reactions
- [ ] Yellow/Orange = Warnings, Old unanswered

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

Test on different screen sizes:
- [ ] Desktop (> 1024px): 5 metric cards in dashboard
- [ ] Tablet (768-1024px): Cards stack appropriately
- [ ] Mobile (< 768px): Single column layout
- [ ] Analytics charts resize properly
- [ ] Navbar collapses or remains accessible

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

### Empty States
- [ ] Analytics with no messages
- [ ] Analytics with no reactions
- [ ] Dashboard with no old unanswered messages
- [ ] Feed with no public replies

### Data Validation
- [ ] Can't add duplicate reactions
- [ ] Analytics period switch updates data
- [ ] Filters work independently
- [ ] Time calculations are accurate

### Error Handling
- [ ] API errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading states appear during data fetch
- [ ] Failed operations don't break UI

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All features are working if:
1. ✅ Analytics page loads and displays all charts
2. ✅ Time-based badges appear correctly
3. ✅ Hot messages are visually distinct
4. ✅ Product categories filter and display
5. ✅ Old unanswered messages are highlighted
6. ✅ This Week metric is accurate
7. ✅ All reactions work bidirectionally (add/remove)
8. ✅ All navigation links work
9. ✅ Mobile responsive
10. ✅ No console errors

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Time-based testing**: Old unanswered messages require waiting 3 days or manual database modification
2. **Multi-user reactions**: Need multiple browsers/sessions to simulate different users
3. **Analytics calculations**: Based on filtered data, may not match if filters are active

---

## 📝 Quick Test Data Setup

If you need more test data:

```sql
-- Create a message 4 days ago (for testing old unanswered)
INSERT INTO messages (id, creator_id, message, tag, created_at)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'This is an old unanswered message for testing',
  'question',
  NOW() - INTERVAL '4 days'
);

-- Create a message from yesterday (for testing This Week)
INSERT INTO messages (id, creator_id, message, tag, created_at)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'This is from yesterday',
  'feedback',
  NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
);

-- Create a brand new message (for testing NEW badge)
INSERT INTO messages (id, creator_id, message, tag, created_at)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'This is a brand new message',
  'confession',
  NOW()
);

-- Add reactions to make a message "hot" (5+ reactions)
INSERT INTO reactions (message_id, reaction_type, user_hash)
VALUES 
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '👍', 'user_1'),
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '❤️', 'user_2'),
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '🔥', 'user_3'),
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '👍', 'user_4'),
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '❤️', 'user_5'),
  ('YOUR_MESSAGE_ID', '👍', 'user_6');
```
