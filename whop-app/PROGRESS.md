## 🚧 In Progress

### Dashboard Updates
The dashboard is being updated to:
- Use MessageCard instead of FeedbackCard
- Filter by tags instead of sentiment
- Handle reply creation
- Toggle reply visibility

### Public Feed Page
Need to create `/pulse/feed` page that:
- Shows all messages with public replies
- Displays reaction counts
- Allows users to add thumbs up reactions
- Clean, simple layout

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Complete Dashboard (app/pulse/dashboard/page.tsx)
```typescript
// Need to update:
- fetchMessages function to use new API structure
- Filter buttons (Question/Feedback/Confession instead of Positive/Negative)
- Metrics calculations (questions vs confessions vs feedback)
- Reply handlers (onReply, onToggleReplyVisibility)
- Update MessageCard usage
```

### 2. Create Public Feed Page (app/pulse/feed/page.tsx)
```typescript
// New page that shows:
- All messages with public replies
- Reaction counts with thumbs up icon
- Add reaction button
- Filter by tag option
- Clean, public-facing design
```

### 3. Test Complete Flow
1. Submit message with tag
2. View in dashboard
3. Reply to message
4. Toggle reply public
5. View in public feed
6. Add reaction

## 🔧 How to Test Current Progress

### 1. Set Up Supabase
```sql
-- Run the SQL from DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
-- This creates all tables with proper structure
```

### 2. Test Message Submission
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/p/testcreator`
- Select a tag (Question/Feedback/Confession)
- Submit a message
- Should see success message

### 3. Test API Endpoints (Postman/curl)
```bash
# Submit message
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"creatorId":"test-creator-id","message":"Test","tag":"question"}'

# Get messages
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/feedback?creatorId=test-creator-id"

# Add reply
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/replies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messageId":"xxx","replyText":"Thanks!","isPublic":true}'
```

## 📊 Feature Comparison

### Before (Sentiment-based Feedback)
