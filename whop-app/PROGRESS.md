## 📋 Next Steps - Testing & Integration

### 1. ✅ Set Up Supabase Database
**IMPORTANT**: Before testing, you need to configure Supabase!

Follow the instructions in `SETUP.md`:
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the SQL from `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
3. Add credentials to `.env.development.local`
4. Restart the dev server

### 2. Test Complete Flow
Once Supabase is configured, test:
1. ✅ Submit message with tag from `/p/testcreator`
2. ✅ View in dashboard at `/pulse/dashboard`
3. ✅ Reply to message with public/private toggle
4. ✅ Toggle reply visibility
5. ✅ View in public feed at `/pulse/feed`
6. ✅ Add reaction (thumbs up)

### 3. Integration Phase (Future)
- Connect Whop MCP for user authentication
- Replace hardcoded CREATOR_ID with real auth
- Add AI-powered message insights
- Weekly report automation

## 🔧 How to Test Current Progress

### 1. Set Up Supabase
```sql
-- Run the SQL from DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
-- This creates all tables with proper structure
```

### 2. Test Message Submission
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/p/testcreator`
- Select a tag (Question/Feedback/Confession)
- Submit a message
- Should see success message

### 3. Test API Endpoints (Postman/curl)
```bash
# Submit message
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"creatorId":"test-creator-id","message":"Test","tag":"question"}'

# Get messages
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/feedback?creatorId=test-creator-id"

# Add reply
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/replies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messageId":"xxx","replyText":"Thanks!","isPublic":true}'
```
